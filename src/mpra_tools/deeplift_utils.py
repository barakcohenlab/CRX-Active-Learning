    """
    Dinucleotide shuffle a one-hot encoded sequence several times to generate a
    background distribution with shap. Note that the dimensionality of the input
    sequence will be shape (4, seq_len) but the function to shuffle expects the
    sequence to be shape (seq_len, 4). Internally, the input sequence gets
    transposed, then the shuffled sequences get transposed back.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_seq : list[Tensor] or None
        If a list, it should be of length one. The sole value should be a
        Tensor with shape (4, seq_len) representing the one-hot encoded
        sequence to shuffle. This is a list of length one for compatibility
        reasons with shap.
    seed : int
        Seed for the numpy RNG. Defaults to 0.
    nshuf : int
        Number of unique shuffles to generate. Defaults to 100.

    Returns
    -------
    result : list[Tensor]
        The dinucleotide shuffled sequences, wrapped within a list of size 1 for
        compatibility reasons. The Tensor will be shape (nshuffle, 4, seq_len).

        dimension is size 1.

    Parameters
    ----------
